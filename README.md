## 📝 Introduction
- Tag('#') is useful for describing your repository. But should you write it by oneself? Isn'it boring??
- So I made a tag generator. Just input the README link. Then the tag generator would analyze the README and generate tags for you!
- Framework : [Gradio](https://gradio.app/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## 🧐 How to use?
- Click the gradio link.
- Input your README link. (ex. https://github.com/Namgyu-Youn/tag-generator/README.md)
- Click the 'Submit' button.
- Enjoy grenerated tags! 🎉 🎉 🎉
